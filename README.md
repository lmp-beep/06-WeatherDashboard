# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

https://lmp-beep.github.io/06-WeatherDashboard/

This weather dashboard will find the current weather and 5 day forecast for any city in the world. Using the Open Weather Map API, the dashboard will give information about current conditions, current temperature, high/low temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The background color of the UV index result will change color from green to yellow to red based on the safety of the level. The user can input any city into the form and that city will be saved to the history list and to local storage. Clicking on a city in the history list will retrieve the information for that city again. The Clear Search History button will delete the list from local storage and refresh the page.
